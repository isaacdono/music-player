# Pico W Game Emulator  

## Introduction  

This project runs on BitDogLab, an educational STEM device equipped with a Raspberry Pi Pico W and various peripherals, including:  
- RP2040 microcontroller (Raspberry Pi Pico W)  
- SSD1306 OLED screen (128x64, I2C)  
- Analog joystick (X/Y axis for movement)  
- Buttons (for menu interaction)  
- Buzzer (for sound effects)
- Microphone (I2C)

The goal is to play songs in an embedded environment using MicroPython.  

## Demonstration
<!-- Place images and videos -->

## How to Run the Project  
1. Flash MicroPython firmware onto the Raspberry Pi Pico W  
2. Run `player.py` file in Pico W using VS Code
